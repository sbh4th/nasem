##  Measuring inequality is not value neutral

- guidance and ethical considerations for selecting measures (e.g., how heterogeneity gets obscured)

- harm that can be done when people use simplistic (and biased) narratives to tell complex stories (based on critique of deaths of despair)

## Need to separate outcomes and determinants

## Grappling with intersectionality
- Young, black, poor, low-educated, female
- Old, white, rich, high-educated, male

## New approaches to measurement

> Narratives matter because they can synthesize and simplify complex phenomena into a single cause-and-effect story. They identify heroes and villains, emphasize particular causes and populations, set the agenda for interventions, and minimize alternative explanations and solutions.
