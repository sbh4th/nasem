## Measures of health inequality are not value neutral
- Scale of measurement (absolute/relative)
- Weighting: how much and to whom?
- Reference points: different from what standard?

- Impact on our judgments of both the magnitude of health inequality and whether health inequalities are worsening or improving.

- Monitoring health inequalities requires both precise measurement and value judgments—they are inseparable.

- A suite of health inequality measures is likely necessary to provide a complete description of the magnitude of inequality.

> we have systematically compared this same set of summary measures of disparity across 22 separate analyses of cancer incidence, mortality, and risk factors and found that, in nearly half of all cases, a substantive judgment about disparity trends required a priori decisions about whether disparities should be measured in [absolute or relative terms]{.red} or whether to use [population-weighted versus unweighted]{.red} disparity measures

## From description to explanation

- The “substance” we want to decompose is health inequality—a difference in health between social groups.

- Ultimately, we want to know why health inequalities are changing over time, or why they differ between populations
  - Risk factors?
  - Demographic composition?
  - Social conditions?

- Unpacking the ‘components’ of health inequality is an opportunity to better integrate the monitoring of health inequalities with the etiology of health inequalities.

## Grappling with intersectional identities
::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
- Health inequalities generated by interlocking systems of power and oppression.

- But often studied by single axes of:
  - Race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability status, socioeconomic status, geography
  - Inattention to joint effects
  
- Inadequate data systems

- Multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (MAIHDA)
- Partial pooling of (intersectoral) social strata
- Can reveal heterogeneity beyond simple additive effects.

## Power of simple narratives

> Our contribution was to link drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related deaths, to note that [all were rising together]{.red}, that together they were [afflicting mostly whites]{.red}, and that, among that group, the long fall in total mortality had stopped or reversed. We also chose the collective label “deaths of despair,” which helped publicize the combined epidemic and emphasize that it included more than just drug overdose.
