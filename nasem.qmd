[Measuring inequalities must be normative and scientific.]{.h2center}

<br>

### [Moving beyond description is essential.]{.blue}

##  Measuring inequality is not value neutral

- guidance and ethical considerations for selecting measures (e.g., how heterogeneity gets obscured)

- harm that can be done when people use simplistic (and biased) narratives to tell complex stories (based on critique of deaths of despair)

## Need to separate outcomes and determinants

## Grappling with intersectionality
- Young, black, poor, low-educated, female
- Old, white, rich, high-educated, male

## New approaches to measurement

## Simplistic narratives create harm?

> Narratives matter because they can synthesize and simplify complex phenomena into a single cause-and-effect story. They identify heroes and villains, emphasize particular causes and populations, set the agenda for interventions, and minimize alternative explanations and solutions.

> Our contribution was to link drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related deaths, to note that [all were rising together]{.red}, that together they were [afflicting mostly whites]{.red}, and that, among that group, the long fall in total mortality had stopped or reversed. We also chose the collective label “deaths of despair,” which helped publicize the combined epidemic and emphasize that it included more than just drug overdose.
