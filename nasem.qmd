## From description to explanation

- The “substance” we want to decompose is health inequality—a difference in health between social groups.

- Ultimately, we want to know why health inequalities are changing over time, or why they differ between populations
  - Risk factors?
  - Demographic composition?
  - Social conditions?

- Unpacking the ‘components’ of health inequality is an opportunity to better integrate the monitoring of health inequalities with the etiology of health inequalities.

- Racial inequality in BP due to risk factors?
- Tobacco, sodium, alcohol, BMI

> ...black participants with [high] blood pressure level have generally better risk factor characteristics...
but the risk factors that we studied could not explain the higher blood pressure levels observed among black participants.

## Grappling with intersectional identities
::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
- Health inequalities generated by interlocking systems of power and oppression.

- But often studied by single axes of:
  - Race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability status, socioeconomic position, geography
  - Inattention to joint effects
  
- Inadequate data systems

## New approaches to measurement

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (MAIHDA)
- Partial pooling of (intersectoral) social strata
- Can reveal heterogeneity beyond simple additive effects.

## Power of simple narratives
::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
> Our contribution was to link drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related deaths, to note that [all were rising together]{.red}, that together they were [afflicting mostly whites]{.red}, and that, among that group, the long fall in total mortality had stopped or reversed. We also chose the collective label “deaths of despair,” which helped publicize the combined epidemic and emphasize that it included more than just drug overdose.

- Much faster increases in opioid overdoses among Blacks *and* American Indian and Alaska Natives in recent years.

## Parting thoughts
- Novel empirical methods exist to go beyond just describing health inequalities.

- When used properly, explanatory methods can help to provide key evidence on why health inequalities exist and change over time.

- Narratives matter: they identify heroes and villains, emphasize particular causes and populations, set the agenda for interventions, and minimize alternative explanations and solutions.
