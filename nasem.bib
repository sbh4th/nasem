	abstract = {To lower the prevalence of hypertension and racial disparities in hypertension, public health agencies have attempted to reduce modifiable risk factors for high blood pressure, such as excess sodium intake or high body mass index. In the present study, we used decomposition methods to identify how population-level reductions in key risk factors for hypertension could reshape entire population distributions of blood pressure and associated disparities among racial/ethnic groups. We compared blood pressure distributions among non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican-American persons using data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003-2010). When using standard adjusted logistic regression analysis, we found that differences in body mass index were the only significant explanatory correlate to racial disparities in blood pressure. By contrast, our decomposition approach provided more nuanced revelations; we found that disparities in hypertension related to tobacco use might be masked by differences in body mass index that significantly increase the disparities between black and white participants. Analysis of disparities between white and Mexican-American participants also reveal hidden relationships between tobacco use, body mass index, and blood pressure. Decomposition offers an approach to understand how modifying risk factors might alter population-level health disparities in overall outcome distributions that can be obscured by standard regression analyses.},

@article{Case:2015aa,
	abstract = {This paper documents a marked increase in the all-cause mortality of middle-aged white non-Hispanic men and women in the United States between 1999 and 2013. This change reversed decades of progress in mortality and was unique to the United States; no other rich country saw a similar turnaround. The midlife mortality reversal was confined to white non-Hispanics; black non-Hispanics and Hispanics at midlife, and those aged 65 and above in every racial and ethnic group, continued to see mortality rates fall. This increase for whites was largely accounted for by increasing death rates from drug and alcohol poisonings, suicide, and chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis. Although all education groups saw increases in mortality from suicide and poisonings, and an overall increase in external cause mortality, those with less education saw the most marked increases. Rising midlife mortality rates of white non-Hispanics were paralleled by increases in midlife morbidity. Self-reported declines in health, mental health, and ability to conduct activities of daily living, and increases in chronic pain and inability to work, as well as clinically measured deteriorations in liver function, all point to growing distress in this population. We comment on potential economic causes and consequences of this deterioration.},

@article{Harper:2007aa,
	abstract = {CONTEXT: Since the early 1980s, the black-white gap in life expectancy at birth increased sharply and subsequently declined, but the causes of these changes have not been investigated.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the contribution of specific age groups and causes of death contributing to the changes in the black-white life expectancy gap from 1983-2003.
DESIGN AND SETTING: US vital statistics data from the US National Vital Statistics System, maintained by the National Center for Health Statistics. Standard life table techniques were used to decompose the change in the black-white life expectancy gap by combining absolute changes in age-specific mortality with relative changes in the distribution of causes of death.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The gap in life expectancy at birth between blacks and whites.
RESULTS: Among females, the black-white life expectancy gap increased 0.5 years in the period 1983-1993, primarily due to increased mortality from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (0.4 years) and slower declines in heart disease (0.1 years), which were somewhat offset by relative improvements in stroke (-0.1 years). The gap among males increased by 2 years in the period 1983-1993, principally because of adverse changes in HIV (1.1 years), homicide (0.5 years), and heart disease (0.3 years). Between 1993 and 2003, the female gap decreased by 1 year (from 5.59 to 4.54 years). Half of the total narrowing of the gap among females was due to relative mortality improvement among blacks in heart disease (-0.2 years), homicide (-0.2 years), and unintentional injuries (-0.1 years). The decline in the life expectancy gap was larger among males, declining by 25% (from 8.44 to 6.33 years). Nearly all of the 2.1-year decline among males was due to relative mortality improvement among blacks at ages 15 to 49 years (-2.0 years). Three causes of death accounted for 71% of the narrowing of the gap among males (homicide [-0.6 years], HIV [-0.6 years], and unintentional injuries [-0.3 years]), and lack of improvement in heart disease at older ages kept the gap from narrowing further.
CONCLUSIONS: After widening during the late 1980s, the black-white life expectancy gap has declined because of relative mortality improvements in homicide, HIV, unintentional injuries, and, among females, heart disease. Further narrowing of the gap will require concerted efforts in public health and health care to address the major causes of the remaining gap from cardiovascular diseases, homicide, HIV, and infant mortality.},

@article{Merlo:2018aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analyzing Body Mass Index as a didactical example, the study by Evans, Williams, Onnela, and Subramanian (EWOS study) introduce a novel methodology for the investigation of socioeconomic disparities in health. By using multilevel analysis to model health inequalities within and between strata defined by the intersection of multiple social and demographic dimensions, the authors provide a better understanding of the health heterogeneity existing in the population. Their innovative methodology allows for gathering inductive information on a large number of stratum-specific interactions of effects and, simultaneously, informs on the discriminatory accuracy of such strata for predicting individual health. Their study provides an excellent answer to the call for suitable quantitative methodologies within the intersectionality framework.
RATIONALE: The EWOS study is a well-written tutorial; thus, in this commentary, I will not repeat the explanation of the statistical/epidemiological concepts. Instead, I will share with the reader a number of thoughts on the theoretical consequences derived from the application of multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (MAIHDA) in (social) epidemiology in general, and within the intersectional framework in particular. MAIHDA is a reorganization of concepts that allows for a better understanding of the distribution and determinants of individual health and disease risk in the population.
CONCLUSIONS: By applying MAIHD within an intersectional framework, the EWOS study provides a superior theoretical and quantitative instrument for documenting health disparities and it should become the new gold standard for investigating health disparities in (social) epidemiology. This approach is more appropriate for eco-social perspectives than the habitual probabilistic strategy based on differences between group average risks. However, both, the translation of intersectionality theory into (social) epidemiology and the intersectional quantitative methodology (especially for generalized linear models) are still under development.},

@article{Evans:2018aa,
	abstract = {RATIONALE: Examining interactions between numerous interlocking social identities and the systems of oppression and privilege that shape them is central to health inequalities research. Multilevel models are an alternative and novel approach to examining health inequalities at the intersection of multiple social identities. This approach draws attention to the heterogeneity within and between intersectional social strata by partitioning the total variance across two levels.
METHOD: Utilizing a familiar empirical example from social epidemiology-body mass index among U.S. adults (N = 32,788)-we compare the application of multilevel models to the conventional fixed effects approach to studying high-dimension interactions. Researchers are often confronted with the need to explore numerous interactions of identities and social processes. We explore the interactions of five dimensions of social identity and position-gender, race/ethnicity, income, education, and age-for a total of 384 unique intersectional social strata.
RESULTS: We find that the multilevel approach provides advantages over conventional models, including scalability for higher dimensions, adjustment for sample size of social strata, model parsimony, and ease of interpretation.
CONCLUSION: Considerable variation is attributable to the within-strata level, indicating the low discriminatory accuracy of these intersectional identities and the high within-strata heterogeneity of risk that remains unexplained. Multilevel modeling is an innovative and valuable tool for evaluating the intersectionality of health inequalities.},

@article{Bor:2023aa,
	abstract = {We assessed how many US deaths would have been averted each year, 1933-2021, if US age-specific mortality rates had equaled the average of 21 other wealthy nations. We refer to these excess US deaths as "missing Americans." The United States had lower mortality rates than peer countries in the 1930s-1950s and similar mortality in the 1960s and 1970s. Beginning in the 1980s, however, the United States began experiencing a steady increase in the number of missing Americans, reaching 622,534 in 2019 alone. Excess US deaths surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching 1,009,467 in 2020 and 1,090,103 in 2021. Excess US mortality was particularly pronounced for persons under 65 years. In 2020 and 2021, half of all US deaths under 65 years and 90% of the increase in under-65 mortality from 2019 to 2021 would have been avoided if the United States had the mortality rates of its peers. In 2021, there were 26.4 million years of life lost due to excess US mortality relative to peer nations, and 49% of all missing Americans died before age 65. Black and Native Americans made up a disproportionate share of excess US deaths, although the majority of missing Americans were White.},

@article{Kaufman:2019aa,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Racial differences in mortality in the United States have narrowed and vary by time and place. The objectives of our study were to (1) examine the gap in life expectancy between white and black persons (hereinafter, racial gap in life expectancy) in 4 states (California, Georgia, Illinois, and New York) and (2) estimate trends in the contribution of major causes of death (CODs) to the racial gap in life expectancy by age group.
METHODS: We extracted data on the number of deaths and population sizes for 1969-2013 by state, sex, race, age group, and 6 major CODs. We used a Bayesian time-series model to smooth and impute mortality rates and decomposition methods to estimate trends in sex- and age-specific contributions of CODs to the racial gap in life expectancy.
RESULTS: The racial gap in life expectancy at birth decreased in all 4 states, especially among men in New York (from 8.8 to 1.1 years) and women in Georgia (from 8.0 to 1.7 years). Although few deaths occurred among persons aged 1-39, racial differences in mortality at these ages (mostly from injuries and infant mortality) contributed to the racial gap in life expectancy, especially among men in California (1.0 year of the 4.3-year difference in 2013) and Illinois (1.9 years of the 6.7-year difference in 2013). Cardiovascular deaths contributed most to the racial gap in life expectancy for adults aged 40-64, but contributions decreased among women aged 40-64, especially in Georgia (from 2.8 to 0.5 years). The contribution of cancer deaths to inequality increased in California and Illinois, whereas New York had the greatest reductions in inequality attributable to cancer deaths (from 0.6 to 0.2 years among men and from 0.2 to 0 years among women).
CONCLUSIONS: Future research should identify policy innovations and economic changes at the state level to better understand New York's success, which may help other states emulate its performance.},

@article{Harper:2010aa,
	abstract = {CONTEXT: Quantitative estimates of the magnitude, direction, and rate of change of health inequalities play a crucial role in creating and assessing policies aimed at eliminating the disproportionate burden of disease in disadvantaged populations. It is generally assumed that the measurement of health inequalities is a value-neutral process, providing objective data that are then interpreted using normative judgments about whether a particular distribution of health is just, fair, or socially acceptable.
METHODS: We discuss five examples in which normative judgments play a role in the measurement process itself, through either the selection of one measurement strategy to the exclusion of others or the selection of the type, significance, or weight assigned to the variables being measured.
FINDINGS: Overall, we find that many commonly used measures of inequality are value laden and that the normative judgments implicit in these measures have important consequences for interpreting and responding to health inequalities.
CONCLUSIONS: Because values implicit in the generation of health inequality measures may lead to radically different interpretations of the same underlying data, we urge researchers to explicitly consider and transparently discuss the normative judgments underlying their measures. We also urge policymakers and other consumers of health inequalities data to pay close attention to the measures on which they base their assessments of current and future health policies.},

@article{Harper:2021aa,
	abstract = {In recent years, life expectancy in the United States has stagnated, followed by three consecutive years of decline. The decline is small in absolute terms but is unprecedented and has generated considerable research interest and theorizing about potential causes. Recent trends show that the decline has affected nearly all race/ethnic and gender groups, and the proximate causes of the decline are increases in opioid overdose deaths, suicide, homicide, and Alzheimer's disease. A slowdown in the long-term decline in mortality from cardiovascular diseases has also prevented life expectancy from improving further. Although a popular explanation for the decline is the cumulative decline in living standards across generations, recent trends suggest that distinct mechanisms for specific causes of death are more plausible explanations. Interventions to stem the increase in overdose deaths, reduce access to mechanisms that contribute to violent deaths, and decrease cardiovascular risk over the life course are urgently needed to improve mortality in the United States.},
