NASEM Remarks

- First, I'd like to thank my co-presenters and Fernando for setting the stage for this session.

- I would like to make two main points with my time today. 

- The first is that decisions about how to measure inequalities involve both normative and scientific choices. 

- The second is moving beyond simple descriptives and 'unpacking' inequalities can help to dislodge inaccurate and potentially biased narratives about the causes of inequalities. 

- Finally, I'd like to highlight some new work that is improving our ability to document the impacts of intersectional identities on health. As we have already heard, data constraints can place severe limits on our ability to reconcile our aspirations for measurement with reality. Small sample sizes and unrepresentative data severely hamper our ability to, for example, assess the impact of exposure to multiple identities. 

- In recent years social epidemiologists have been taking advantage of multi-level models typically used to look at individuals clustering within neighborhoods or counties, and instead using them to look at how individuals cluster within intersectional social strata. 

- The key idea here is that

- As many of you are aware, life expectancy at birth in the US has not only stagnated, but declined dramatically in recent years, even before the disaster of the COVID-19 epidemic. 

- Measures like life expectancy are valuable in the sense of being easy to understand, but they measure a complex reality of causes, and can lend themselves to simplistic narratives.
